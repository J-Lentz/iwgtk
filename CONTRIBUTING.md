# Contribution policy

Spammy, AI-generated PRs are a growing problem in the open source community.
Such PRs undermine the high-trust nature of the open source community and waste
maintainers' time.

Therefore, if you're a new contributor submitting your first PR to this project,
please send a short email to me (jesse@twosheds.org) introducing yourself.
Please briefly explain your interests, background, and your motivation for
contributing. Questionable PRs from new contributors with no introductory email
will be rejected without review.

I lament that this policy is needed, and I apologize for any inconvenience that
it may cause. Legitimate contributions (from actual humans) are appreciated and
encouraged.
